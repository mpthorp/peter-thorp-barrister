        <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
        <p>
          During my 41 years of practice, I have gained extensive experience before all Courts and a wide range of Tribunals and other bodies.  Since commencing practice as a Barrister 23 years ago, I have specialized in general civil commercial advice and dispute resolution and appeared principally in the High Court and Court of Appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          My specialist expertise in civil commercial advice and dispute resolution includes litigation, mediation, arbitration and negotiation and involves a wide range of legal areas including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Administrative Law</li>
          <li>Construction Law</li>
          <li>Intellectual Property</li>
          <li>Contract and Tort</li>
          <li>Company Law and Trusts</li>
          <li>Insurance Law</li>
          <li>Statutory Management and Liquidation</li>
          <li>Sports and Charitable Trusts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I have been retained as lead counsel in a number of cases involving novel questions of law, some of which are leading cases in their field.  I have also been retained in cases in Australia and the Cook Islands.
        </p>
        <p class="footnote">
          Examples of significant cases in which I have been retained are contained in my full curriculum vitae which is available on request.
