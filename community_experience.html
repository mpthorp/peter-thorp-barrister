        <h1>Community Experience</h1>
        <h2>The Kimberley Trust and The Kimberley Housing Charitable Trust</h2>
        <p>
          I am Chairman of two substantial registered charitable Trusts, the Kimberley Trust and The Kimberley Housing Charitable Trust, that own commercial and residential properties worth in excess of $22 million and operate Childcare Centres in Greenlane and Te Atatu in Auckland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Myself and my fellow Trustees are all Christians and members of the Greenlane Christian Centre to which the Trusts donate significantly.  The Trusts are presently in the planning stage of a substantial commercial development on some of their properties.
        </p>
        <h2>Mount Albert Grammar School</h2>
        <p>
          I was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Mt Albert Grammar School between 1995 and 2006 and a member between 1995 and 2006.  I was President of the Albertians Association for 4 years and am a member of the School’s Hall of Distinction.
        </p>
        <h2>Ponsonby Rugby Club Incororpated</h2>
        <p>
          I was also Chairman of Ponsonby Rugby Club Incorporated between 1999 and 2011 and a member of the Management Committee of the Club between 1993 and 2011.  The Club is the Auckland Rugby Football Union’s oldest and most successful.  It has produced more All Blacks and international players than any other club in New Zealand and fields more teams than many provincial unions.  During my term as Chairman, the Club won the premier Auckland trophy, the Gallaher Shield, for a record 8 consecutive and 10 out of 11 years.
